									<h3>
										Semantic Measures: How Similar? How Related? 
									</h3>
									<p class="publisher">
										Springer International Publishing
									</p>
									<p class="date"> June 2016</p>
									<p class="description">
										There are two main types of semantic measures (SM): similarity and relatedness. There are also two main types of datasets, those intended for similarity evaluations and those intended for relatedness. Although they are clearly distinct, they are similar enough to generate some misconceptions.
										Is there a confusion between similarity and relatedness among the semantic measure community, both the designers of SMs and the creators of benchmarks? This is the question that the research presented in this paper tries to answer. Authors performed a survey of both the SMs and datasets and executed a cross evaluation of those measures and datasets. The results show different consistency of measures with datasets of the same type. This research enabled us to conclude not only that there is indeed some confusion but also to pinpoint the SMs and benchmarks less consistent with their intended type

										Reducing Large Semantic Graphs to Improve Semantic Relatedness
									</h3>
									<p class="publisher">
										Springer - CCIS
									</p>
									<p class="date"> 2015 </p>
									<p class="description">
										In the previous research the authors developed a family of semantic measures that are adaptable to any semantic graph, being automatically tuned with a set of parameters. The research presented in this paper extends this approach by also tuning the graph. This graph reduction
										procedure starts with a disconnected graph and incrementally adds edge types, until the quality of the semantic measure cannot be further improved. The validation performed used the three most recent versions of WordNet and, in most cases, this approach improves the quality of
										the semantic measure.

										Tuning a Semantic Relatedness Algorithm using a Multiscale Approach
									</h3>
									<p class="publisher">
										Computer Science and Information Systems
									</p>
									<p class="date"> 2015 </p>
									<p class="description">
										The research presented in this paper builds on previous work that lead to the definition of a family of semantic relatedness algorithms. These algorithms depend on a semantic graph and on a set of weights assigned to each type of arcs in the graph. The current objective of this research is to automatically tune the weights for a given graph in order to increase the proximity quality. The quality of a semantic relatedness method is usually measured against a benchmark data set. The results produced by a method are compared with those on the benchmark using a nonparametric measure of statistical dependence, such as the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The presented methodology works the other way round and uses this correlation coefficient to tune the proximity weights. The tuning process is controlled by a genetic algorithm using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient as fitness function. This algorithm has its own set of parameters which also need to be tuned. Bootstrapping is a statistical method for generating samples that is used in this methodology to enable a large number of repetitions of a genetic algorithm, exploring the results of alternative parameter settings. This approach raises several technical challenges due to its computational complexity. This paper provides details on techniques used to speedup the process. The proposed approach was validated with the WordNet 2.1 and the WordSim-353 data set. Several ranges of parameter values were tested and the obtained results are better than the state of the art methods for computing semantic relatedness using theWordNet 2.1, with the advantage of not requiring any domain knowledge of the semantic graph

									<h3>
										Challenges in Computing Semantic Relatedness for Large Semantic Graphs
									</h3>
									<p class="publisher">
										IDEAS '14 Proceedings of the 18th International Database Engineering & Applications Symposium / ACM
									</p>
									<p class="date"> July 2014 </p>
									<p class="description">
										The research presented in this paper is part of an ongoing work to define semantic relatedness measures to any given semantic graph. These measures are based on a prior definition of a family of proximity algorithms that computes the semantic relatedness between pairs of concepts, and are parametrized by a semantic graph and a set of weighted properties. The distinctive feature of the proximity algorithms is that they consider all paths connecting two concepts in the semantic graph. These parameters must be tuned in order to maximize the quality of the semantic measure against a benchmark data set. From a previous work, the process of tuning the weight assignment is already developed and relies on a genetic algorithm. The weight tuning process, using all the properties in the semantic graph, was validated using WordNet 2.0 and the data set WordSim-353. The quality of the obtained semantic measure is better than those in the literature. However, this approach did not produce equally good results in larger semantic graphs such as WordNet 3.0, DBPedia and Freebase. This was in part due to the size of these graphs. The current approach is to select a sub-graph of the original semantic graph, small enough to enable processing and large enough to include all the relevant paths. This paper provides an overview of the ongoing work and presents a strategy to overcome the challenges raise by large semantic graphs.

										The research presented in this paper builds on previous work that lead to the definition of a family of semantic relatedness algorithms that compute a proximity given as input a pair of concept labels.
